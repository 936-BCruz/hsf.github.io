Scarlet Norberg is a post-doc at University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez doing research in physics beyond the standard model with machine learning influences. She currently is working on finishing up a super symmetry analysis which requires tops in the final state, and takes advantage of machine learning to tag those tops. She works hard to pass on the knowledge she has gained in schools like this and beyond.
